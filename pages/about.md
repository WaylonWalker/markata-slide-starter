## slide zero

slides are split on h2 (##)

## slide one

slides numbers get appended to the articles slug `presentation-1/slide-1`

## slide two

slide numbers are zero indexed.

## hotkeys

when you are on a route with `slide-#`, you can use `j` and `k` to navigate between slides.

## The presentation is still a page

[[presentation-1]] is rendered entirely on its own page just as any normal post would be.
